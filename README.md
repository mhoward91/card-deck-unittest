# Card-Deck-Unittest

Comprehensive unit testing script testing methods relating to a deck of cards, implemented using a Card & Deck class.

## Description

The primary purpose of this project is to demonstrate my ability to write, understand and execute unit tests. The unit tests are based on two classes and their associated methods, intended to represent a deck of cards. An individual card is represented as an instance of the Card class, while the Deck class has a list attribute, which holds each of the 52 card objects.

Each of the methods contained within these two classes are tested in the unit tests.
